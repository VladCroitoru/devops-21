# Service level agreement (SLA)

# Introduction



This Service Level Agreement (&#39;SLA&#39;) for Minitwut, applies to the Minitwut services listed herein, but does not apply to any other services suplied by Group L.
This SLA describes the levels of service that the users of the Minitwut application (the &#39;Users&#39;) will receive from Group L. (&#39;Vendor&#39;).

If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for an apology from the Vendor. The Vendor reserves the right to terminate this SLA, and the associated services without prior notice. 
# Definitions
"**Downtime**" means that a service is unreachable, or is otherwise unable to process requests complying with the expected format of the API or website.

"**Error Code**" means an indication that an operation has failed, such as an HTTP status code in the 5xx range.

"**Incident**" means (i) any single event, or (ii) any set of events, that result in Downtime.

# Services covered

This SLA covers only those services provided by the Vendor to the Users for purposes of accessing the Minitwut website, as well as the corresponding API. This SLA contemplates only those above-named services and makes no guarantees or representations as to the provision or availability of any other service that may be provided by the Vendor.

# Limitations

This SLA is written in good faith. Vendor will always do everything possible to rectify every issue in a timely manner. However, this SLA does not apply to any performance or availability issues:

- Due to factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);
- Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;
- Not adhering to the format specified for the API

# Guaranteed uptime

In order to enable the Users to access the system effectively, the Vendor guarantees that certain services will be available for the following percentage of time.

The API of Minitwut is guaranteed to have a 95% uptime.

The Minitwut web interface is guaranteed to have a 95% uptime.

# Measurement and penalties

Uptime is measured over each calendar month. It is calculated to the nearest minute, based on the number of minutes in the given month (for instance, a 31-day month contains 44,640 minutes).

If uptime for any item drops below the relevant threshold, the users may file for an apology from the Vendor.

To file for an apology the User must submit their claim to the Vendor with all information necessary for the Vendor to verify the incident,  including but not limited to: (i) a detailed description of the Incident; (ii) information regarding the time and duration of the Downtime; and (iii) descriptions of your attempts to resolve the Incident at the time of occurrence, as well as the Error codes reported by Minitwut.
